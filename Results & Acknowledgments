##Results

This was an excelent project to get inmerse in the workflow of a Data Science, and the results to the business questions briefly explained are the following:

1. Which are the most relevant clientâ€™s traits and how can they be group to get a better understanding of them?
Demographic: Gender, age and income. 
Psychographic: transactional forecasted affinities. 
Business related: savings and investments products. 
Behavioral: Digital affinity, saving behavior, spending behavior and credit behavior, credit score. 
Geographical: City.

2.  How does the open rate of emails behave in young clients, 18 to 30 years old?
The open rate in young clients have a left skewed distribution, its mean is 9% but it has a considerable standard devation of 18%.

3. Is a multivariate regression model based on the variables identified an acceptable model to predict open rate?
The r^2 is too low to use this type of model in production.
Therefore it's recomended to look for other models in order to get a better fit, random forest is a suggestion that should be evaluated.
