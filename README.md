# Davivienda_DS_project
This will be a toy prject to practice git commands.


A brief story about my current role and the ongoing project:

Not so long ago I change a job in finance for the opportunity to work in one of the most promising new areas of my company, Marketing Intelligence. Our main goal is no understand our client and for this it’s important to leverage technologies to get closer to him. As a beginner in analytics, this project is an opportunity to materialize some of my learnings and use the tools given by Udacity to bring up data solutions for current problems.
    
The first problem I would like to address is which variables that affect email’s open rates and if there’s any way to forecast future campaigns.   This is what this project is all about and it will be addressed as following:

1.	Gather information about the campaigns.
2.	Explore the information.
3.	Make a predictive model that could forecast open rate of future campaigns.
